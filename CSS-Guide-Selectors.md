## What Is CSS?
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that describes the presentation of a webpage written in HTML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and spacing, allowing web pages to be visually appealing and accessible. Let’s explore the key concepts of CSS that every beginner should know.

## Basic Structure of CSS
In CSS, rules consist of selectors and declarations. A selector targets specific HTML elements, and the declaration block contains CSS properties and their values that define the styles applied to those elements.

### **Example of a CSS rule**:

p { 

color: blue;

font-size: 16px

 }


### **Purpose**: 

Selector: Targets < p >;  elements.

Property: color, font-size.

Value: The style applied (e.g., blue, 16px).

## Essential CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements that you want to style.

## Type Selectors

### Purpose: Selects HTML elements by their tag name.

### Example:
h1 { 

color: green; 

}

This rule targets all < h1 > elements and applies the color green.

## Class Selectors

### Purpose: Targets elements with a specific class attribute.

### Example:

.intro { 

font-size: 20px; 

}

This targets elements with the class intro and sets the font size to 20px.

## ID Selectors

### Purpose: Targets a specific element with a unique ID.

### Example:

This targets elements with the class intro and sets the font size to 20px.

## ID Selectors

### Purpose: Targets a specific element with a unique ID.

### Example:

This targets an element with the ID header and sets its background color to yellow.

## Attribute Selectors

### Purpose: Selects elements based on their attributes.

### Example:

input[type="text"] { 

border: 1px solid black

 }
 
This targets all <input> elements where the type is text and adds a black border.

## CSS Layout Selectors

## The Box Model

### Purpose: Controls the spacing around elements.

The box model includes margin, border, padding, and content. It defines how elements are spaced and sized.

### Example:

div { 

margin: 20px; 

padding: 10px; 

border: 2px solid black; 

}

## Flexbox

### Purpose: A modern layout system for creating flexible, responsive designs.

### Example:

.container { 

display: flex; 

justify-content: space-between;

` }

This creates a flexible container where items are spaced evenly within.

## Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements

### Purpose: Styles elements when a user hovers over them.

### Example:

a:hover { 

color: red;

 }
 
This changes the link color to red when hovered.

::before and ::after

### Purpose: Allows you to insert content before or after an element’s content.

### Example:

p::before { 

content: "Note: "; 

color: blue; 

}

This inserts the word “Note:” before every paragraph and makes it blue.

## Media Queries

### Purpose: Used to apply different styles based on device size or screen resolution.

### Example:

@media (max-width: 600px) { 

body { 

background-color: lightblue;

}

 }
 
This changes the background color of the page to light blue when the screen width is 600px or smaller, making your design responsive.

# Conclusion

Understanding these essential  tags is the first step toward creating structured, readable, and SEO-friendly websites. While HTML forms the backbone of a webpage, it is often combined with CSS for styling and JavaScript for functionality. Mastering these tags will lay a strong foundation for any aspiring web developer.
